The threshold to classify ""severe"" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item ""having not eaten for an entire day"" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to several of the most severe experiences described in the FIES questions, such as to have been forced to reduce the quantity of the food, to have skipped meals, having gone hungry, or having to go for a whole day without eating because of a lack of money or other resources.
